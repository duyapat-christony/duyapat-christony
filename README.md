  Hello 👋😊! I'm **[Christony Duyapat](https://duyapat-christony.github.io)**, your delightfully boring but **occasionally** entertaining math teacher 👨‍🏫 and wannabe data detective 📊. When you see me glued to my laptop or phone with my study mode on, I am just watching random reels or memes and pretending they’re very educational.

  I started diving into data analytics to add a little spice to my otherwise boring life. I’m starting to realize it might be a bit too spicy and demanding for my pretty small brain capacity! 🤯

> [!NOTE]
> Fun fact: I once tried to count how many times I blink in a day. Turns out, I am terrible at counting but I guess I’m pretty good at blinking!

> [!TIP]
> Pro tip: If you’re bored, try counting how many times you blink in a day. It’s surprisingly entertaining! 🤭

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you start chatting with me, be prepared for a conversation as thrilling as a math lecture. You might feel a bit sleepy. 🥱

> [!WARNING]
> If I seem to be zoning out, it's not that I’m ignoring you. I’m just cringing over some embarrassing moments from years ago. Please cut me some slack! 🫣

> [!CAUTION]
> If you’re hoping for wild adventures, you might need to lower your expectations. I’m just a regular boring guy. 😴
