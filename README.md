  Hello 👋😊! I'm **[Christony Duyapat](https://duyapat-christony.github.io)**, your delightfully boring but **occasionally** entertaining math teacher 👨‍🏫 and wannabe data detective 📊. When you see me glued to my laptop or phone with my study mode on, I am just watching random reels or memes and pretending they’re very educational.

  I started diving into data analytics to add a little excitement to my otherwise boring life. I’m starting to realize it might be a bit too demanding for my pretty small brain capacity🤯!

> [!NOTE]
> Fun fact: I once tried to count how many times I blink in a day. Turns out, I am not good at counting but I guess I’m pretty good at blinking!

> [!TIP]
> Pro tip: If you’re bored, try counting how many times you blink in a day. It’s surprisingly entertaining! 🤭

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you start chatting with me, be prepared for a conversation as thrilling as a math lecture. You might feel a bit sleepy 🥱.

> [!WARNING]
> If you see me deep in thought, I might be coming up with excuses to escape my deadlines. Please be considerate 😐.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you’re hoping for wild adventures, you might need to lower your expectations. I’m just a regular guy with a boring life 😴.
